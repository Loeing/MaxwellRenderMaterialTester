Batch Rendering Script for Case HPC

usage: ./batch_render.sh MXS_DIR OUTPUT_DIR [PROJECT_NAME]

This script finds all the .mxs files in MXS_DIR, renders all of them with
Maxwell Renderer using as many cluster jobs as it can without exceeding the
license limits, and outputs the resulting png images to OUTPUT_DIR with the
same names, plus diagnostic log files.
